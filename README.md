# C-Sharp-Windows-Form-Hit-Test-or-Collision-detection

This process is very simple but its quiet effective when it comes to simple games design because we need this feature in any game to recognise when to objects are overlapping with each other. Windows Form is not traditonally built for games design but its fun to make something more interactive in it.
